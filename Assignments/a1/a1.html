<p>
<b>Always keep at least one backup copy of your work!</b> Your work will consist of three web pages (files).<br><br>
<b>Question 1:</b> Have one main page, called <i>index.html</i>, with your identification, and links to the two other web pages that you will produce in this assignment.
<br>Put your name and e-mail address in italics on your main page, somewhere lower, on the right side. <a href="HomePage_a1.jpg" target="A1">Here</a> is an example of how this page may look.
</p>

<p>
<b>Question 2:</b> <b>dinner.html</b>.
Here is a  <a href="DinnerMenu.jpg" title="Dinner over the Ocean Menu" target="A1">screenshot</a> of a web page you must reproduce <i>exactly.</i> The web page must be in a separate file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>At the end of the page, create a link to the home page (<i>index.html</i>).</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Question 3:</b> Use an Internet search engine (e.g. www.google.com) to research <big><b>only one</b></big> of the following topics, given below.   Follow up on one or two references, then on a separate web page, write a short summary (three - four paragraphs) neatly laid out. In each case, give the URL of the site where you found your inspiration. Make the site(s) active links. <br>

Summarize in your own words - do not lift text directly from the online reference, except possibly for one brief, direct quote.
</p>

<ul>
<li>At the end of the page, create a link to the home page (<i>index.html</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember to give each of your pages a title (use the <i>title</i> tag) and a title <i>heading</i> in the body of your document. Use the <b>&lt;br&gt;,   &lt;p&gt;,</b> and <b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> tags carefully.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Choose <font size=+1><u>ONLY ONE</u></font> of the topics below for question 3</i>:</b>

<ol type="A">

	<li>	The world of Harry Potter.  You can talk about Harry, his friends, Albus Dumbeldore, Quidditch, Hogwarts school, etc.<br>
You should have about 3 - 4 paragraphs. [file name: <font face="Courier" size="+1">potter.html</font>]</li>
<br>
	<li>	The world of "The Big Bang Theory". You can talk about Sheldon, Leonard, Amy, Bernadette, Rajesh, Penny, Howard, etc. <br>
You should have about 3 - 4 paragraphs. [file name: <font face="Courier" size="+1">bigbang.html</font>]</li>
<br>
	<li>	What are -- in your opinion -- the "ingredients" of success? Make a list of a few items (up to 5) and elaborate on them. This is not an essay!<br>
You should have about 4 - 5 paragraphs. [file name: <font face="Courier" size="+1">success.html</font>]</li>
<br>
</ol>

<p>
Here is a <a href="sample28.jpg" target="A1">sample</a> to give you an idea for your presentation.
Do <i>not</i> reproduce the model <i>too</i> closely. Red backgrounds are hard on the eye. Also avoid dark background colours as much as possible, they are hard to read even if the font is in a contrasting colour.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
In designing each web page: start from the top of the page, and check with the browser the parts that you complete, as you go down the page. Save often! For fonts, find close approximations, if the exact font is not available.<br>

For choosing colours and finding their hexadecimal representations,  refer to web sites from where you can freely download a colour-picking application, or one with a colour palette. You may find this link particularly useful: 
<a href="http://html-color-codes.info/" target="new">http://html-color-codes.info/</a>
<br> <br>

Below you'll find a quick guide on using hexadecimal colour codes:<br><br>
