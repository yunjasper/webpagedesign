<h3>Exercise 1:</h3>
</a>


<div>
Create a new link from your home-index page (in the "pub" folder) to an Art section of your creation. The "art" folder must be separate from the "assignments" and from the "hobbies" folders, but of course contained in the "pub" folder.<br>
<p>The "art" home-index page is to have  a nice photograph (not a thumbnail) of an artwork of your choice (painting, sculpture, architecture, landscape architecture,  jewellery,  pottery, etc.).
Resize the width and height so that the picture is not too large. 
Put it in the center, top. Have two links at the bottom to different art
pages, <i>for example,</i> one page on Renaissance Italian painting, and one on 19-th century Russian painters. 
<br> <br>
For each of these two pages you have some freedom of decision, but your work must satisfy the following requirement: <br> <i>in addition</i> to the usual headings and navigational links, you <b>must</b> include a picture (not a thumbnail/ icon) of the topic (say a landscape), with a descriptive text around it.
<br><br>
On one page the text is on the right side of the image, on the other page the text flows on the left side of the image. (Check the examples shown in class.) Use the ALIGN, HSPACE, VSPACE, BORDER, ALT, TITLE, WIDTH, HEIGHT attributes. 
<br><br>
Use a soft background color. (<i>See examples shown in class and/or examples on the website of <a href="http://www.cookwood.com/html" target="_new">this book</a>.</i>)
</p>



<p> You are of course free to choose any other nation's art, if that reflects your interests or expertise.
</p>


<p><b>Maximum size</b> for all the images on your site is <b>400 by 400 pixels</b>. The size of the image file should be maximum 300 KB.

<h3>Exercise 2:</h3>
<div>

</a>
<p>
Update this assignment, and retroactively Assignments 1 and 2, with image-links as described below.
 These images must be up to <b>40 by 40 pixels</b>. Of course, you may resize them proportionally. <br><br>
Remember to update your home page (created in the last assignment), by adding this and the subsequent new assignments. When you do this, make the links pointing at the three major topics so far (Assignments, Hobbies, Art) either part of an <i>unordered list</i>
 <u>or</u> organize them nicely on the <i>same row.</i></p>


<ol>

	<li>Find a <b>home</b> icon on the Internet, and put it near the top of 
the pages linking back to the main home (index) page. Make it active as a link back to your home page. <i>Do not remove the existing textual links.</i>
	<br>See list of sites at the end of the assignment.</li>

	<li>Find a small icon of a <b>computer</b> and put it near the top of your home page. Make it active as a link to your <i>Assignments</i> page.</li>


	<li>Find a small icon of a <b>hobby</b> and put it near the top of your home page. Make it active as a link to your <i>Hobbies</i> homepage.</li>



	<li>Find a small icon of a <b>painting</b> and put it near the top of your home page. Make it active as a link to your <i>Art</i> homepage.</li>

<h3>Exercise 3:</small></h3>
</a>
 



<div>

Create a fictional advertisement page for a product of your choice. The product can be fictional too! Make it about one screenful.

<ul>

	<li>Use all the elements on images you know so far.</li><br>


	<li>Use an image as background. To do this, use BACKGROUND as an attribute to BODY.  The <i>value</i> of this attribute must be the name of the image file, including its relative path. <br>
Choose carefully this image: it has to be a soft image, that does not interfere with the text and images that you want to display. Remember that this is just the background; the real information, your message, is in the text and the other images.</li><br>


	<li>Have some short descriptive text as well, marketing your product.</li> <br>


	<li>Optional, if you think necessary, you may use thumbnails of your products, making each act as an image link to bigger pictures, found on other pages of yours.</li><br>


	<li>Have an alternate text for all your images: use the ALT and the TITLE attributes of IMG.</li><br>


	<li>Include two mapped images. On each of these mapped images, you should have three (3) shapes: one rectangle, one circle, and one polygon. Check the example presented in class.</li><br>


Another example of mapped image is <a href = "http://www.elizabethcastro.com/html6ed/examples/links/map.html" target = "example">here</a>.<br><br>

	<li> Out of the total of 6 mapped links, at least three (3) must be pages created by you. </li> <br>

	<li>On your home page, create a new topic, <i>"Advertisement"</i>, similar to <i>Assignments</i>, <i>Hobbies</i>, <i>Arts</i>.</li><br>


	<li>In your <i>pub</i> folder, create also a new folder called "<b>advertisement</b>" (at the same level with <i>assignments</i>, <i>hobbies</i>, <i>arts</i>). Put all files related to your advertisement in this folder. Create a subfolder of <i>advertisement</i>, called <i>images</i>,
to store all pictures related to this section.</li><br>
	<li>Find an appropriate icon for "<b>advertisement</b>" and use it as described in <b>Exercise 2</b>.</li><br>


	<li>Update the <b>a3</b> (<i>assignment3</i>) page: write a short description of this assignment and put two links: one to the art page and the other one to the advertisement page (i.e. to what you created in this assignment).</li><br>
