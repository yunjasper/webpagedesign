<p> This is the final project of the course. To mark this moment, there are some differences as compared to the previous assignments:
<ul>
<li>You work in a team of 2 (not more than 3!) -- instead of working alone</li>
<li>You use an HTML editor (instead of Notepad)</li>
<li>You can choose the topic of the project (among the topics suggested below) </li>
</ul>
<p>
After you read the <b>whole</b> page and you have an idea on what topic you want to work on, get in touch with your partner who must have a DIFFERENT topic from yours. Once both of you (you and your partner) decide on your topics and you both agree to work together, you start working!
</p>
<p>
You will use an <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html_editor"
                   target="_new"><b>HTML editor</b></a> of your
choice. Of course, you'll make a search for such an editor. Some of them
-- not all of them -- are free. One place to look for an HTML editor
would be on <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=html+editor&btnG=Google+Search&meta="target="_new">Google</a>; another place would be
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors" target="_new">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you must, you can also look for <abbr title="Find out its name!">one</abbr> that is on the Marianopolis' network...
</p>
<p>Why <b>HTML editor</b>? Because once you learn how to use it (which shouldn't take too long) you can create webpages with a minimum amount of code typing. Why do I tell you now about such a software? Because from time to time you still need to type some code which will be easier now, with all the knowledge and experience accumulated in the previous assignments.
</p>
<p> If you already have such a software and you want to use it - <i>just do it</i>! If not, look for one (see above)!
</p>

<hr align="center" />
<p><b>Note:</b> Separately from the webpages that you create for this project, you have to submit a report on the HTML editor that you used (for details of the report, see <a href="#submit">What to Submit</a> section of this page). If you and your partner used the same editor, you submit one single report; otherwise, one report is required for each editor used.</p>
<hr>

<p>Once you decide on the HTML editor, you explore it and you use it to create and/or expand <b>ONE</b> of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<a name="ttt"></a>
<br>
<li>A simple <b>Tic-Tac-Toe game</b>, using the colours <b>red</b>
and <b>blue</b> instead of <i>X</i> and <i>O.</i> The "board" is a 3-by-3 frameset. In it, the initial content of each frame is a tiny webpage consisting of just <i>two links,</i> one to a mini-page with no content other that a red background colour, the other identical to this, except with blue background colour. Alternately, if you prefer, link to a graphic image consisting of all red/all blue respectively. If you choose this, try to fill the entire frame area with the chosen colour.<br>
The links themselves should stand out, and use your imagination in their design. At first (in the design stage) work with two simple textual links, and then replace them with small thumbnail sized images (red/blue) as links to the "real thing".<br>
Here is an <a href="webtactoe.jpg" target="tictac">example</a> to help you.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b>: You are <i>not</i> playing against the computer, that would require <i>programming</i> (it can be done, but goes way beyond the level of this course). You are designing the game for two human players who pass the mouse to each other.<br><br>
</li>

<a name="alpha"></a>
<li>A <b><i>non-latin alphabet</i></b> , e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Tamil, ..., with a very short explanation of the phonetics, the direction of text (left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical, etc.), a copy of the alphabet itself and a few friendly examples for illustration, e.g. a nice "Hello", a peace message, etc. <i>Of course</i>, you are required to give a <i>sample</i> of the alphabet and an English translation of the messages, please!<br>
Use online information to find explanations on this topic. The information could be about <b>Declaring Your Page's Character Encoding</b> and <b>Specifying Your Page's Language</b>. The <b>Character Encoding </b>is declared in the &lt;head&gt; section, as the <b>charset</b> attribute to the &lt;<b>meta</b>&gt; tag.<br>
This is what the browser uses to recognize the alphabet you used. Do not waste time trying to <i>create</i> your message in a wordprocessor. Just fish it out on the Internet. Once you found a page you like, in the language of your choice, examine the source of that page to find the <b>charset</b> code. <br><br>

</li>

<a name="magic"></a>
<li>A <b>magic square</b>. It consists in a frameset of 3 by 3 and each cell offers the possibility to display a number from 1 to 9. The goal of this game is to obtain a total of 15 horizontally, vertically and diagonally - all in the same time! Each number has to be used only once (see <a href = "MagicSq_Ex.html" target="_new">example</a>). At the bottom of the window, you have two links: one for a new game and the other to display a solution to the problem. In other words, more frames...<br>
Of course, you must have a link back to "final project" (see below) and you may consider an extra-link (on each 'big' number) for "correction". 
<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b>: You are <i>not</i> playing against the computer, that would require <i>programming</i> (it can be done, but goes way beyond the level of this course.) You are designing the game for one human player who uses your webpage as a gameboard.<br><br>
</li>
<b>OR</b><br><br>
<a name="hobby"></a>
<li>Instead, expand your <b>Hobby page</b>, using as much as possible from what you've seen during the second half of the semester: image mapping, tables, frames.
</li>


</ol>

<hr size="5" color="black"/>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whatever your choice is, you are required to use an <b><i>external style sheet</i></b> for the pages involved in this final project. Inspire yourself freely from the <b>examples</b> presented in the lab.</p>
<p>As well, you must have on your page a link back to the <a href="#fp-menu">final-project menu</a>.</p>

<hr size="5" color="black"/>

<a name="submit"></a>
<u>What to <b>submit</b></u>:<br>
[<i>More technical details on how to "merge" your work with your
  teammate's work will be given after the second test.</i>]

<ol type="I">

<li> The two sections of the final project (yours and your partner's)
  will be placed in a folder called <b>final-project</b>, which will
  contain two sub-folders named using your family name and
  Marianopolis ID number. The <b>final-project</b> folder will also
  contain an <b>index.html</b> page with the a header indicating the
  course name, date, and student's names, and including the following
  three links:
<a name="fp-menu"></a>
<ul>
<li>Topic ONE (name the topic) - <i>author 1</i></li>
<li>Topic TWO (name the topic) - <i>author 2</i></li>
<li>Editor Report(s)</li>
</ul>
Feel free to find a nicer solution (e.g.: centered one-column table, centered one-row table).<br> <br>

  <li> a <i>webpage</i> (named <b>report.html</b>) for each HTML editor used, situated in the same folder <b>final-project</b>, containing the following (in its <i>body</i>):
<ol>
<li> A header identifying you, your partner, the course, your topics, and the date.</li>

<li> A brief description of your work (i.e. the chosen subject)</li>

<li> Two or three (meaningful) <a href="create-snapshot.html" target="_new">snapshots</a> of your topic. </li>

<li> A report (about 500 words), on the <b>HTML editor</b> that you used, like a <i>tutorial</i> explaining the software to a friend, with the following parts:

<ol type="a">
<li> An introduction, explaining briefly what the <b>editor</b> is.  Explain how to start it up, what to do and <i>not</i> to do, etc.</li>

<li> The steps you followed to create your pages and your site.</li>

<li> The features of the <b>editor</b> that were helpful, user-friendly, efficient.</li>

<li> The features of the <b>editor</b> that could be improved, in your opinion.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>You will be marked on the clarity of your webpage(s), as well as on the analysis of the software, on the clarity of your tutorial, and on your critical evaluation of the <b>HTML editor</b> that you used.
